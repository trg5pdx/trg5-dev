## trg5.dev

This is the repo for my personal website, written using nextJS, react, and
TailwindCSS. For the list of resources I used to develop my site, you can look
at either the citations page on the live website, or scroll to the bottom of
this readme to see it.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Here are the resources I used for developing this site

For navigation, I used this resource for building a navigation bar with TailwindCSS.

For setting up sending emails from a form, I used the resource below for
getting that working.

For generating the cards for the projects section, I followed the link below
for understanding the basics for mapping, and I chose to set it up to use a
static index since thats something I didn't plan to have change dynamically.

Used this for getting breakpoints to work with swiper

Used the example react portfolios below to help me get started with developing
this website, and give me ideas for what I could do. I want to point out
paytonjewell's specifically since I took a look at that one for inspiration on
how to handle the data in my website.
